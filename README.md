Our prime directive:

Using technology to put nature to work in order to solve human problems.

What does that mean?:

At Plan A Biotech we’re working to help solve some of humanities hardest problems, such as climate change, clean water, and hunger among many others. However what we’ve found is that all of these problems have a common potential solution: Computer Programmable Cellular “Factories.”

Imagine that you could have the economic might of an entire factory, shrunken down, and able to multiply in productivity given only raw materials, and time. A whole fleet of factories solving problems by having solutions fed to them by AI guided via human wants and needs. Now lets imagine that those factories could manufacture on the molecular level, and that they could exist wherever life can exist. In the atomosphere? No problem. On the bottom of the ocean? you’re darn tootin. In  conditions dangerous to human beings? Yes. Most likely if you can make a case for somewhere that life could exist, be it in a board room or aboard a rocket to Mars, then Plan A Biotech is working to make your fantasy reality.

So. How does this solve something like, say climate change? Simple. You program these factories to consume carbon emissions and make other more human/earth friendly substances. Such as, oxygen, vital nutrients, medicines, and more.

Those are only some of the examples of what Plan A Biotech has in the mind when we say “Use technology to put nature to work in order to solve human problems.”
